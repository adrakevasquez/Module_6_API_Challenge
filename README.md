# Python-API-Challenge

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, I create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, I used the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide through the process of using Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
