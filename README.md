# Python-API-Challenge

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, I create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, I used the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide through the process of using Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.

Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, I used weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, I used Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API

The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.

The main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations
